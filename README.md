Developed a functional calculator application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The interface is designed to replicate the aesthetic of an iPhone calculator, featuring responsive buttons, a sleek layout, and accurate calculations. Key functionalities include basic arithmetic operations, toggle for negative/positive numbers, and error handling for invalid inputs.
